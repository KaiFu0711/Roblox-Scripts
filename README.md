Hello!
To get to a game by an ID use: "roblox.com/games/(ID)" . So it would look like "roblox.com/games/6547644883" 
Next to Execute a script use: loadstring(game:HttpGet(' put script link here '))() to get a link click on any File above and then 
click on "Raw" then just copy link from your browser and paste it in the loadstring
